# PotholeRep
An android application to detect and classify pothole based on image, and then report to the database

## Project Title: 
Pothole Detection and Severity Classification: A Mobile Application of Image Recognition and Machine Learning for Improved Road Maintenance

## Introduction:
This project presents a novel approach to address urban road maintenance issues, particularly focusing on pothole detection and classification in the United Kingdom. Utilising advancements in machine learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), combined with smartphone technologies, this system aims to revolutionise the traditional methods of pothole reporting, making them more efficient and user-friendly​​.

## Key Features:
Machine Learning Model: Incorporates SSD with MobileNetV2 for efficient object detection and classification of potholes​​.

Mobile Application: User-friendly interface designed using Flutter SDK, allowing real-time image capture, upload, pothole detection, and classification​​.

Data Handling: Uses Firebase Realtime Database for secure data storage, ensuring GDPR compliance and data privacy​​.

## Installation and Usage:
Ensure Flutter SDK and dependencies (TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, and Pandas) are installed.
Clone the repository and build the application.
Run the app on a compatible device to capture or upload images for pothole detection.
